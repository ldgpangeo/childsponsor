<h3>•	Can I write to my sponsored child?</h3>
<p>Get to know your sponsored child more personally by exchanging letters with them. These  are a few helpful tips:</p>
<p>
It's important when writing to your child to consider his or her Ugandan culture and environment .  Feel free to share things about your family, friends, and your interests.  You can always include your photos which are very special to African children and will become treasure. Also nice are stickers and pictures of where you live.</p>
<p>It is best when you write not to write about things you own as our children have few things, but it is your love and letters that they will most cherish.
</p>
<p>Address your letters to: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
     Your Childs full name
     The Giving Circle Africa
     P.O. 107, Jinja, Uganda
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please do not enclose your monthly sponsorship gift or any cash with your correspondence. Please contact info@thegivingcircle.org if you wish to send a gift for advice on the correct procedure.

<h3>•	Can I send packages to my sponsored child?</h3> 
<p>No, that is not possible because the Uganda postal system charges a hefty fee for pickup of anything other than a letter.
